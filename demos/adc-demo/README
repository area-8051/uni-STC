Reads an ADC channel every 2 seconds and displays its value on the 
serial console.

You should connect a known voltage source on ADC channel 0 (or 3 on 
an STC8G1KxxA), but you may also leave it floating for the fun of it.

On STC8, the value of channel 15 (internal voltage reference) will 
also be displayed.
