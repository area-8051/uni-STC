 * Test setup ==========================================================
 * 
 * This test uses an STC8H1K28-36I-LQFP32.
 * An USB-to-serial adapter must be connected to P3.0 and P3.1.
 * A signal generator must be connected to P1.0.
 * 
 * The program will print the measured frequency and duty cycle to the 
 * serial console every second.
 * 
 * Start with a 1kHz signal with a 50% duty cycle, then vary the 
 * frequency (max. range: 1Hz-100kHz) and the duty cycle.
 * =====================================================================
