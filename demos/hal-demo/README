This example demonstrates the use of several HAL features:

- delay.h
- gpio-hal-h
- pca-hal.h
- timer-hal.h
- uart-hal.h
- Serial console support
- Multiple MCU support (including makefiles)
- Flash usage reduction

The application blinks an LED connected to a GPIO pin, glows another 
LED connected to a PCA channel using 8-bit PWM, and echoes characters 
received from the serial console.

Pins used vary depending on the MCU, see project-defs.h for details.

Several makefiles are provided to fit very different MCU. 
To build one, type: make -f <name of the makefile>
e.g.: make -f STC8A8K64S4A12.mk
Again, the only source file affected by your choice is project-defs.h.
