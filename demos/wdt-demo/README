Blinks an LED using the watchdog timer.

The LED's cathode must be connected to P5.4.

The code is written to generate 4 long flashes followed by 4 short ones,
but beacause we (deliberately) fail to clear the watchdog in time in 
the second loop, you should see 4 long flashes and only 2 short flashes.
