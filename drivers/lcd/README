This is a modular driver for LCD modules such as the 1602, 2004 or 12864.

Basically, an LCD module consists of 3 physical parts:

- The LCD array itself => display size
- The LCD controller => capabilities (e.g. graphics support)
- The communication interface between the MCU and the LCD controller.

The driver's code provides objects to support those 3 physical entities:

- lcd-device.h represents an LCD module as a whole.
- lcd-interface.h represents the communication interface.
- lcd-controller.h defines the functions that must be implemented to
support a given a controller.

Because the communication interface has both a logical state and 
a physical link, the lcd-link-impl.h file defines the functions that
must be implemented to support a given physical link type (e.g. I2C, 
parallel).

2 controller implementations are provided in the controllers/ directory:

- HD44780.c provides support for text-only modules (e.g. 1602, 2004)
- ST7920.c provides support for graphics-capable modules (e.g. 12864)

3 physical link implementations are provided in the links/ directory:

- lcd-link-i2c provides support for PCF8574-based I2C interfaces
- lcd-link-parallel provides support for 8- and 4-bit parallel interfaces
- lcd-link-serial provides support for the ST7920's serial interfaces

In addition to the driver itself, 2 services provide high-level display 
API to the developer:

- lcd-text provides text-mode display API
- lcd-graphics provides graphics-mode API

In order to use this modular driver in your application, you need to:

- Copy all the files from this directory into your project's directory
(you may omit lcd-graphics if you don't need it).

- Copy exactly one file from the controllers/ subdirectory into your
project's directory.

- Copy exactly one pair of files (.c/.h) from the links/ subdirectory 
into your project's directory.

- Add them to your Makefile.

- See uni-STC/demos/i2c-demo for an example of use.

I welcome help requests, comments and suggestions.
