 * 
 * 15-bit enhanced PWM abstraction definitions.
 * 
 * Supported MCU:
 * 
 *     STC15W4KxxS4
 *     STC8A8KxxS4A12
 *     STC8A8KxxD4
 *     STC8G2K*
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * 
 *     gpio-hal
 * 
 * IMPORTANT1: on the STC8G2K*, only PWM20..27 are supported, and 
 * correspond to PWM_Channel0..7 respectively.
 * 
 * Rationale: the STC8G2K* seems to be an exception as STC never
 * manufactured another MCU with as many PWM channels. Instead, the
 * advanced 16-bit PWM of the STC8H family offers 8 channels again.
 * It seems the industry just wants more _independent_ PWM channels, 
 * and _not_ a higher total count of PWM outputs.
 * 
 * The purpose of a HAL being to reduce complexity and increase 
 * hardware independence, using a maximum of 8 PWM channels was
 * the most sensible option.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT2: on the STC15W4K*, STC numbered enhanced PWM channels 
 * PWM2..7 (the 2 available CCP channels counting for PWM0 and PWM1 
 * in their mind). However, enhanced PWM channels on the STC8A are 
 * numbered from 0 to 7. Furthermore, PWM2 SFRs on the STC15 are at 
 * the same addresses as PWM0's on the STC8A.
 * 
 * For consistency, I decided to number the enhanced PWM channels
 * of the STC15 from 0 to 5, aligned with those of the STC8A, as 
 * this improves portability between MCU families (the first enhanced
 * PWM channel is always PWM0 on all MCU).
 * 
 * IMPORTANT3: when using interrupts, don't forget to declare your
 * interrupt service routine, this HAL module doesn't provide one.
 * Its prototype must be either, for the STC8G2K:
 *     INTERRUPT_USING(__enhpwm_isr, PWM2_INTERRUPT, 1);
 * or, for all other MCU:
 *     INTERRUPT_USING(__enhpwm_isr, PWM0_INTERRUPT, 1);
