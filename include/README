This is the root directory of uni-STC.

You need to add it to your compiler's command line: 
sdcc -I/path/to/uni-STC/repository/include [..other options...]

The uni-STC/ subdirectory contains header files describing peripherals 
and features. A single stcmcu.h header file includes them all for 
convenience, it's the only one you should use.

Some definitions not MCU-related are provided in the testing.h header 
file for use in unit tests built with GCC (see uart-hal for an example).

The STC/ subdirectory contains one subdirectory per MCU model under 
which are one header file per MCU package. This allows for a very 
fine-grained control over peripherals/features support.

In your application, you'll only want to use these files, e.g.:
#include <STC/8A8KxxS4A12/LQFP48.h>

However, if the MCU you're using doesn't have its header file yet, 
you'll need to create it. It MUST contain at least the following 
macro definitions:

- MCU_FAMILY e.g. 8
- MCU_SERIES e.g. 'G'
- MCU_PINS, e.g. 8

Depending on the particular features and peripherals offered by your 
specific MCU, you may need to define other macros. See existing files
for examples.

Once the appropriate macros are defined, all you need to do is:
#include <uni-STC/stcmcu.h>

And, lo and behold, your MCU can use the full HAL if you fancy.
